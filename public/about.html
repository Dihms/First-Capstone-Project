<p>I work as a nurse for 12 years now. But as mush as I like to care for my patients, my first passion is really technology.</p>

<p>I found coding really cool and entertaining. That's why once I start studying web development since 12th October, 2023, I've never stop learning from it.</p>

<p>I enrolled myself in Udemy under the teaching of Angela Yu and it is great. And now, for under a week, I now learned the fundamentals of HTML.</p>

<p>Next Stop: CSS</p>
